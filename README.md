Deck Project
============
Author: Avnish Soni
Date: 27 July 2016

Summary
-------
This application is essentially a simple Console program which enables the user to produce a fresh deck of cards, shuffle them, and deal as many cards as requested.

Technologies
------------
C# .NET 4.5
Visual Studio Community 2015
MS Test

Approach
--------
I used a conventional TDD approach (red - green - refactor) using Visual Studio's inbuilt MS Test framework.  Note that I could have used NUnit or Moq for more advanced tests.  I chose a simple Console app for this task, although I plan on building this in WPF/Prism going forward and can send on the final product later.

To Run
------
DeckProjectClient\bin\Release\DeckProjectClient.exe

Code
----
All code, runnable in Visual Studio, can be run via DeckProject.sln.
